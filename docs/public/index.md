# Welcome to Lunaris Civitas

**Lunaris Civitas** is a simulation engine that models human societies, resources, and complex systems over time. Think of it as a digital laboratory where you can observe how populations grow, resources are managed, jobs are created, and societies evolve—all without any human players controlling the action.

## What Is This?

Lunaris Civitas simulates a virtual world where:

- **People** are born, grow up, work jobs, have needs (food, water, rest), and eventually pass away
- **Resources** like food, water, electricity, and money are produced, consumed, and managed
- **Systems** interact automatically—people need food, so they work jobs to produce it, which affects the economy, which influences population growth
- **Time** passes hour by hour, day by day, year by year—you can simulate decades or centuries

This is **not a game**—there's no user interface to play with. Instead, it's a **research and analytics tool** that runs in the background and produces data you can analyze. Perfect for researchers, analysts, or anyone curious about how complex systems behave over time.

## What Can You Do With It?

- **Run scenarios**: What happens if food production drops? How does the population respond?
- **Study trends**: Track resource levels, population growth, employment rates, and health metrics over time
- **Model systems**: Understand how different configurations affect outcomes
- **Research**: Use the data exports for analysis, visualization, or academic research

## Key Features

- **Deterministic**: Run the same scenario twice with the same settings, get the same results (perfect for testing)
- **Configurable**: Control everything through simple configuration files—no programming required
- **Resumable**: Stop and resume simulations anytime—perfect for long-running scenarios
- **Data-rich**: Export detailed history data for analysis in spreadsheets or visualization tools
- **Modular**: Systems work independently—you can enable or disable features as needed
