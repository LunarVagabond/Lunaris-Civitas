# Development Phases

## Overview

Lunaris Civitas is being developed in phases, building from a minimal core engine to a comprehensive simulation platform. Each phase adds capabilities while maintaining the core principles of determinism, modularity, and extensibility.

## Core Design Principles

1. **No system talks directly to another system** - All interaction via world state
2. **Everything is config + stats** - Data-driven behavior
3. **Humans never "decide"** - Systems decide probabilistically
4. **Every feature must be disable-able** - Modular and optional
5. **If it can't be graphed, it's not real** - Analytics-first design
6. **Complexity is allowed only when isolated** - Systems are independent

## Phase 0: Simulation Spine (Foundation)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Prove the engine works with a minimal, stable core.

**Deliverables:**
- Tick scheduler (1 tick = 1 hour)
- System registry and contract
- Event bus (modifiers system)
- SQLite persistence
- Config loader + snapshot system
- Seeded RNG for determinism

**Test Criteria:**
- Run 10 years with fake entities
- Restart sim, resume state exactly
- Add a dummy system later and migrate cleanly

**Key Constraint:** No humans. No fun stuff. This phase is boring but critical.

---

## Phase 1: Resources & World State

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Scarcity exists. Resources can be produced, consumed, and replenished.

**Deliverables:**
- `Resource` model (food, water, electricity, oil, etc.)
- Resource production system (natural/baseline)
- Resource consumption system (natural/baseline - decay, evaporation)
- Resource replenishment system (natural - rain, growth)
- Frequency support (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Modifier system for buffs/debuffs

**No humans yet** - just abstract consumers/producers.

**Why This First:**
- Lets you debug depletion, growth, collapse
- Sets up economic pressure *before* humans exist
- Establishes baseline natural processes

---

## Phase 2: Base Human (Minimal Survival)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Humans don't die immediately. Basic survival mechanics.

**Deliverables:**

**Human Components:**
- `Needs`: hunger, thirst, rest
- `Inventory`: personal resources
- `Health`: simple health status
- `Age`: birth date, lifespan tracking
- `Pressure`: unmet resource requirements
- `Wealth`: money/resources
- `Employment`: job information
- `Household`: household linkage

**Systems:**
- `HumanSpawnSystem`: Creates initial population and runtime spawning (TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER for Phase 3 reproduction system)
- `NeedsSystem`: Updates needs with randomized per-entity decay rates (hourly ticks)
- `HumanNeedsFulfillmentSystem`: Actively fulfills needs through RequirementResolverSystem (hourly ticks)
- `HealthSystem`: Converts pressure and unmet needs into health degradation (hourly ticks)
- `DeathSystem`: Handles death from health degradation and age-based mortality (hourly ticks)
- `RequirementResolverSystem`: Resolves resource requirements through multiple sources

**Constraints:**
- No families (household component exists but not fully utilized)
- No jobs (employment component exists but not fully utilized)
- Basic money/wealth tracking
- Just survival

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Humans can survive with adequate resources
- ✅ Humans die when resources depleted
- ✅ Population can grow/shrink based on resource availability
- ✅ All decay and satisfaction amounts use randomized ranges
- ✅ Age-based mortality allows rare outliers past 100

**Note**: `HumanSpawnSystem` runtime spawning is a temporary placeholder and will be replaced by a proper reproduction system in Phase 3.

## Phase 2.5: Actions System

**Status:** 🔜 Planned (Likely next phase)

**Goal:** Entities perform time-based actions (eating, sleeping, working) that occupy them for periods of time.

**Deliverables:**

**Components:**
- `Action` component - Current action being performed
- `ActionQueue` component - Planned actions
- `Traits` component - Individual characteristics (sleep needs, metabolism, etc.)

**Systems:**
- `ActionSystem` - Manages entity actions and state transitions (hourly ticks)
- `ActionSchedulerSystem` - Plans actions based on needs and priorities (hourly ticks)
- `TraitSystem` - Applies trait effects to actions and needs (hourly ticks)

**Features:**
- Action types: `eat`, `sleep`, `work`, `rest`, `travel`, etc.
- Actions take time (e.g., sleep 6-12 hours)
- Entities are "occupied" during actions (can't perform other actions)
- Traits affect action requirements:
  - Sleep needs: Some need 6 hours, others need 10 hours
  - Metabolism: Some need more food, others less
  - Activity level: Some need more rest, others can work longer
- Action priorities based on need levels
- Action interruption (emergency needs override current action)

**Design Decisions:**
- Actions are time-based, not instant
- Entities can only perform one action at a time
- Actions can be interrupted by critical needs
- Traits create individual variation in action requirements
- Action system enables more realistic behavior modeling

**Why This Matters:**
- Makes entity behavior more realistic
- Enables proper sleep cycles (entities sleep 6-12 hours)
- Foundation for work schedules, daily routines
- Allows for individual variation through traits
- Better models human time constraints

## Tick Model

The simulation uses a layered tick system:

| Tick   | Used For                                    |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Minute | Biological needs, emergencies               |
| Hour   | Work shifts, travel, resource production    |
| Day    | Consumption, sleep, crime checks             |
| Month  | Economy, rent, taxes, policy updates        |
| Year   | Aging, births, deaths, politics, pandemics   |

Systems register for specific ticks:

```python
HealthSystem.run_on = ['hour', 'day']
EconomySystem.run_on = ['month']
DemographicsSystem.run_on = ['year']
```

---

## System Architecture

### Core Engine (Tiny, Boring, Sacred)

**Never changes much.**

Responsibilities:
- Tick scheduler
- Entity registry
- System registry
- Event bus (modifiers)
- Persistence (SQLite)
- Deterministic RNG (seeded)

**It should NOT know:**
- What hunger is
- What crime is
- What politics is
- What a pandemic is

### Systems (Plug-ins)

Everything else is a **system module**.

Each system:
- Declares what components it reads
- Declares what components it writes
- Declares which ticks it runs on
- Declares its config schema

This is *huge* for extensibility.

### Entities + Components (ECS-lite)

**Do NOT over-engineer ECS.**

Simple structure:
```
Entity {
  id
  components: Map<ComponentType, ComponentData>
}
```

Examples:
- `Human`
- `Household`
- `City`
- `Country`
- `Organization`
- `ResourceNode`

Components:
- `Needs`
- `Inventory`
- `Health`
- `Location`
- `Wealth`
- `Employment`
- `Relationships`
- `PoliticalAffiliation`

Systems operate on *components*, not entity types.

---

## Config-Driven World Initialization

**Key Insight:** Config drives everything.

Flow:
1. Read config files
2. Migrate DB schema if needed
3. Populate missing systems / components
4. Lock config snapshot into DB
5. Run simulation

When adding a new system:
- Config is re-read
- DB is migrated
- New system state is initialized
- Existing entities get default components if needed

**This avoids resets.**

---

## Future Considerations

### Interface/Context Objects

**Status:** Deferred

Consider adding standardized interfaces for resource operations when:
- Multiple systems need similar operations
- Change tracking/analytics needed
- Transaction-like behavior required
- Testing becomes difficult

**Current approach:** Direct world state interaction is sufficient for Phase 1-2.

### ECS Implementation

**Status:** Deferred until Phase 2

When humans are added, implement ECS-lite:
- Simple component system
- Not over-engineered
- Systems operate on components
- Easy to extend

---

## Phase Completion Criteria

Each phase must:
- ✅ Pass all tests
- ✅ Maintain determinism (same seed = same results)
- ✅ Support save/resume
- ✅ Be configurable
- ✅ Be disable-able
- ✅ Not break previous phases
- ✅ Have documentation

---

## Notes

- Phases build on each other
- Each phase adds capabilities without breaking existing ones
- The core engine remains stable
- Systems are hot-addable
- Config drives behavior
- Everything is data-driven
