# Development configuration for Lunaris Civitas simulation
#
# TIME MODEL:
#   - 1 tick = 1 hour
#   - Resources have replenishment_frequency (natural replenishment timing)
#   - Production/consumption systems have per-resource frequencies (natural production/decay timing)
#   - Rates are per frequency period (e.g., if frequency is 'monthly', rate is per month)
#   - These represent baseline natural processes; future systems (humans, jobs) will add additional consumption/production

  ResourceProductionSystem:
    # Natural/baseline production rates
    # Format: resource_id: rate (hourly default) or {rate: X, frequency: 'Y'}
    # These represent natural production processes (e.g., plant growth, solar generation)
    production:
      food: 100.0      # produces 100 food per hour (default: hourly)
      water: 150.0    # produces 150 water per hour (default: hourly)
      electricity: 300.0  # produces 300 electricity per hour (default: hourly)
      # Example with custom frequency:
      # wood:
      #   rate: 50.0
      #   frequency: daily  # produces 50 wood per day
  
  ResourceConsumptionSystem:
    # Natural/baseline consumption rates (decay, evaporation, etc.)
    # Format: resource_id: rate (hourly default) or {rate: X, frequency: 'Y'}
    # These represent natural consumption processes (e.g., evaporation, spoilage)
    consumption:
      food: 80.0      # consumes 80 food per hour (default: hourly) - natural spoilage
      water: 120.0    # consumes 120 water per hour (default: hourly) - evaporation
      oil:
        rate: 10.0
        frequency: monthly  # consumes 10 oil per month - natural degradation
      electricity: 250.0  # consumes 250 electricity per hour (default: hourly) - natural loss
  
  ResourceHistorySystem:
    # Resource history tracking for analytics
    # frequency: 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', or 'yearly'
    # rate: Save every N periods (e.g., rate=2 means every 2 days)
    # resources: [] = all resources, or list specific resource IDs
    enabled: true
    frequency: daily  # Save history daily at midnight
    rate: 1  # Every 1 day
    resources: []  # Empty = track all resources
